== Description ==

Promote your websiteâ€™s content with many kinds of post lists. No programming skills are necessary. With just a few keyboard entries and clicks you get a customized posts list. The plugin Ultimate Post List for WordPress gives you an easy-to-use toolbox to make lists of posts.

You can insert the lists **in every widget area** and via a shortcode **in every post content**.

You can switch between a **vertical list layout** or a **responsive grid layout**. A few options help you to get a nice layout without any need to code.

The plugin is **multi-widget capable**. That is, you can have several widgets of Ultimate Post List on your blog, each with its own settings!

You can clone (duplicate, copy) every list with a single click on the action link.

The plugin is available in English and German (Deutsch).
